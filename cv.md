## Professional Summary  

I am a Wireless LAN technology leader with more than 24 years of experience across Qualcomm, Atheros, Broadcom, Athenasemi, and Telesilikon. Over the course of my career, I have worked extensively on 802.11 standards, chip definition, silicon bring-up, software design, device drivers, firmware, and the delivery of customer features. My expertise spans WLAN product design for access points, scan radios, and stations, with solutions deployed across enterprise, retail, and carrier segments.  

In recent years, I have focused on developing Wi-Fi based solutions that integrate AI and machine learning to enhance network performance, enable predictive diagnostics, and improve anomaly detection. I have also played a key role in product definition and engineering, guiding products from concept through deployment.  

Alongside my technical contributions, I have managed and mentored highly motivated engineering teams and successfully led cross-functional collaborations across hardware, software, and verification groups distributed across geographies. My work has consistently delivered end-to-end WLAN solutions adopted in high-volume markets worldwide.
